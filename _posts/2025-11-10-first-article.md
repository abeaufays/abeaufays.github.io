title: Don't use your brain when you don't need to

Idée générale

- certaines tâches prennent du temps, de la concentration qui n'est donc pas utile à la tâche initial
- je veux optimiser l'usage de ma concentration

## Don't use your brain when you don't need to

When learning how to use a computer, I was baffled at how simpler it was to handle files with a terminal compared to the windows-based interface I was used to.

The only things you need to have in mind are: the name of the command to use, the name of the file(s) you want to manipulate, and optionally where you are realtively to these files.

No need to be aware of where the file is in the interface, or skim throught the right click contextual menu to find the action you need.

There is no overhead of

When I realized how much time I was wasting just to:

- lift my hand off the keyboard
- grab the mouse
- hunt for the cursor on screen
- and _finally_ do what I want 😵

Leading me to find again other ways to **not use the mouse**

Now if I have to do the same thing more than twice, I try to look up for a shortcut or alternative way to do it without thinking.

I fell down the rabbit hole, and now I'm bringing you with me.

### The ultimate Chrome trick

I use Chrome as a web browser, and I'm often very tempted by shiny new browsers but they all lack one feature...

| **`Ctrl+Shift+A`: search in your open tabs.** _(or `Cmd+Shift+A` on Mac)_

You remember opening an article about how to use protocol in Python, but you got interrupted and now it's lost in a random window ?

`Ctrl+Shift+A "pro"` and you're back on it !  
_(Maybe more than `pro` depending of your amount of open tabs with the same subject)_

> It also shows the tab playing audio first !

### Praise the Command Palette

What about those shortcuts you barely use ?

Do you really want to memorize a shortcut to "Compare the current file with the clipboard" ?  
It's useful when needed but do you really want this to take a place in your brain ?

Some applications (such as VSCode) hav
Recall one shortcut to unlock all of them.

> If you are working on any app I may use, please add a Command Palette 🥺

### Stop using `Alt+Tab`

Who still uses `Alt+Tab` in 2025 ??

Me for the most part of it ... But now **I've entered the future**.

Using a tiling windows manager changed my life, now I have a workspace for each app

_Workspace 1: Communication app (Slack)_  
_Workspace 2: Work related Browser_  
_Workspace 3: IDE_  
_Workspace 4-8: Others depending on context_  
_Workspace 9: Personal browser_

Then instead of search for the right app in my `Alt+Tab`, I just press `Alt+[number]` and instantly switch this app.

With a bit of practice and setup, it takes no more thinking power to navigate between windows.

Depending of the size of the monitor I can be a bit more creative and use the tiling part of "tiling window manager", for example I fit the ticket with the IDE, or a preview if I'm working on a frontend task.

I'm in a situation where I use Windows on my personal desktop, Ubuntu on my laptop and Mac at work.

**Windows:** [GlazeWM](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm)  
**Mac:** [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace)  
**Ubuntu:** I3 _(I have not tested it yet)_  
**Arch:** Hyprland _(I have not tested it)_

### Vimium

### QMK Keyboard

#### What about split keyboard ?
