title: Optimize my mind by optimizing my keyboard
---

As [someone who works on a computer](/about) all day (and plays on one too), I've become a shortcut addict.

If I have to do the same thing more than twice, I try to look up for a shortcut to do it.

At some point, I realized how much time I was wasting just to:
- lift my hand off the keyboard
- grab the mouse
- hunt for the cursor on screen
- *finally* do what I wanted 😵

Leading me to find again other ways to **not use the mouse**

I fell down the rabbit hole, and now I'm bringing you with me.

### The ultimate Chrome trick

I use Chrome as a web browser, and I'm often very tempted by shiny new browsers but they all lack one feature...

| **`Ctrl+Shift+A`: search in your open tabs.** *(or `Cmd+Shift+A` on Mac)*

You remember opening an article about how to use protocol in Python, but you got interrupted and now it's lost in a random window ?  

`Ctrl+Shift+A "pro"` and you're back on it !  
*(Maybe more than `pro` depending of your amount of open tabs with the same subject)*

> It also shows the tab playing audio first !

### Praise the Command Palette
> If you are working on any app I may use, please add a Command Palette 🥺

### Stop using `Alt+Tab`

Who still uses `Alt+Tab` in 2025 ?? 

Me for the most part of it ... But now **I've entered the future**.

Using a tiling windows manager changed my life, now I have a workspace for each app 

*Workspace 1: Communication app (Slack)*  
*Workspace 2: Work related Browser*  
*Workspace 3: IDE*  
*Workspace 4-8: Others depending on context*  
*Workspace 9: Personal browser*  

Then instead of search for the right app in my `Alt+Tab`, I just press `Alt+[number]` and instantly switch this app.

With a bit of practice and setup, it takes no more thinking power to navigate between windows.

Depending of the size of the monitor I can be a bit more creative and use the tiling part of "tiling window manager", for example I fit the ticket with the IDE, or a preview if I'm working on a frontend task.

I'm in a situation where I use Windows on my personal desktop, Ubuntu on my laptop and Mac at work.  

**Windows:** [GlazeWM](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm)  
**Mac:** [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace)  
**Ubuntu:** I3 *(I have not tested it yet)*  
**Arch:** Hyprland *(I have not tested it)*  

### Vimium

### QMK Keyboard
#### What about split keyboard ?
